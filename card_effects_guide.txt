"continuous" - does the card stay on the field after summon and after finishing the card effect. The effects of non-continuous cards activate instantly after summon and then the card is removed from the field.
"autoEffect" - does the player need to click on something to finish the card effect after activation, if yes then autoEffect = true.
"effect": <string_representing_the_card_effect>
"effect1Value": <integer> // NOT USABLE FOR NOW
"effectsCount": <integer> // NOT USABLE FOR NOW
"energyPerUse": <integer>, this field is only valid for continuous cards. How much energy per use does it cost to activate the continuous card effect.
"continuousEffectType": <string_representing_continuous_effect_type>, Example: "onClick", "everyStandbyPhase", ...
"effectChargesCount": <integer>, this field is valid only for continuous cards and represents how many times in total you can activate the cards effect before the card is destroyed. Normally 1 charge is used for every activation of the card. When a charge is used, depends on the "continuousEffectType".
"maxUsesPerTurn": <integer>, this field is valid only for continuous cards with "continuousEffectType": "onClick", and represents how many times you can activate the card's effect each turn.
"energyPerUseIncrement": <integer>, this field is valid only for continuous cards and represents how the energy will change on every use of the card, e.g.: +1
"effectValueIncrement": <intger>, how the effectValue will change on when a condition specified in "effectValueIncrementCondition" is met, e.g.: x2
"effectValueIncrementCondition": <string>, the condition on which the effectValue will change based on "effectValueIncrement", e.g.: totalUsedCharges
"effectValueIncrementConditionFilter": <string>, subcondition for "effectValueIncrementCondition" on which the effectValue will change, e.g.: every1, which means that on every 1 unit specified in "effectValueIncrementCondition" the effectValueIncrement will be applied.
