1. Add Help screen in Main Menu
1.1 In Help screen add 2 more screens
1.1.1 Rules Screen explaining how the game works and what you should do: phases, characters, board, cards etc.
1.1.2 Cards Screen where you can browse all the cards in the game and see their description etc. like the hover over card in-game.
Also there must be a filters for easier searching for specific cards: card name filter, card attributes, continous or not.

2. Add leveling system. Each matchmade game you play must give you a certain amount of XP, if you win, you get more XP.
The XP you gain should mainly depend on the total time spent in-game and win/lose. Other factors could be:
- was the other player higher lvl than you, if yes then gain more XP than usual.

3. Character abilities.
There must be a number of characters from which you can choose who give you some kind of passive bonus in-game, example:
- draw 2 cards on first draw phase
- roll dice 2 times on first roll phase

You should be able to choose a character before matchmaking.
You should be able to choose default character from settings menu.
