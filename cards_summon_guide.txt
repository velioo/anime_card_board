By default on every Main Phase you can summon: (2 common) OR (1 common AND 1 rare) OR 1 epic cards
So the ratio respectively is 2:1:1

If you want to give the player the opportunity to summon one more common card per turn, you can do it
by incrementing the common_cards_per_turn++

If you want to give the player the opportunity to summon one more rare card per turn, you can do it
by incrementing the common_cards_per_turn += 2 AND rare_cards_per_turn++, so the effect of the card will be sth like:
You can summon 2 common or 1 rare cards more every turn, it, can't be only rare

If you want to give the player the opportunity to summon one more epic card per turn, you can do it
by incrementing the common_cards_per_turn += 2 AND rare_cards_per_turn++ AND epic_cards_per_turn++
, so the effect of the card will be sth like: You can summon 2 common or 1 rare cards or 1 epic card more every turn,
it, can't be only epic

DEPRECATED, BAD IDEA...
